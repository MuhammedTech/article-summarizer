`Article Summarizer` is a software that allows `anyone` to do `Article Summarization by just inputting an URL`.

Article Summarizer is an app that summarizes any article by just getting its URL. It implements NLTK, Beautiful Soup, and Regular Expression to effectively extract the keywords and output summarization of the article.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

   ###### OUTPUT
```
 Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural-language generation. Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models. [17] The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.
